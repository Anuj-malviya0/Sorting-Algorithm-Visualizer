# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

creating a sorting Algorithm Visualizer using a pygame module

## Merge sort
```python
# Python program for implementation of MergeSort
def mergeSort(arr):
	if len(arr) > 1:

		# Finding the mid of the array
		mid = len(arr)//2

		# Dividing the array elements
		L = arr[:mid]

		# into 2 halves
		R = arr[mid:]

		# Sorting the first half
		mergeSort(L)

		# Sorting the second half
		mergeSort(R)

		i = j = k = 0

		# Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
		while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
			if L[i] < R[j]:
				arr[k] = L[i]
				i += 1
			else:
				arr[k] = R[j]
				j += 1
			k += 1

		# Checking if any element was left
		while i < len(L):
			arr[k] = L[i]
			i += 1
			k += 1

		while j < len(R):
			arr[k] = R[j]
			j += 1
			k += 1

# Code to print the list


def printList(arr):
	for i in range(len(arr)):
		print(arr[i], end=" ")
	print()


# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
	arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
	print("Given array is", end="\n")
	printList(arr)
	mergeSort(arr)
	print("Sorted array is: ", end="\n")
	printList(arr)


```




## Insertion sort
```python
# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort

# Function to do insertion sort
def insertionSort(arr):

	# Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
	for i in range(1, len(arr)):

		key = arr[i]

		# Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
		# greater than key, to one position ahead
		# of their current position
		j = i-1
		while j >= 0 and key < arr[j] :
				arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
				j -= 1
		arr[j + 1] = key


# Driver code to test above
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
insertionSort(arr)
for i in range(len(arr)):
	print ("% d" % arr[i])

```


## Selection sort
```python
# Python program for implementation of Selection
# Sort
import sys
A = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

# Traverse through all array elements
for i in range(len(A)):
	
	# Find the minimum element in remaining
	# unsorted array
	min_idx = i
	for j in range(i+1, len(A)):
		if A[min_idx] > A[j]:
			min_idx = j
			
	# Swap the found minimum element with
	# the first element	
	A[i], A[min_idx] = A[min_idx], A[i]

# Driver code to test above
print ("Sorted array")
for i in range(len(A)):
	print("%d" %A[i]),

```

## Bubble sort
```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
 
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
 
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
 
            # traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater
            # than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
 
# Driver code to test above
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
 
bubbleSort(arr)
 
print ("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print ("%d" %arr[i]),
```
## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? 

I learned how different types of sorting algorithms work and how pygame module works

What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

firstly the first challange i need a  functon that will draw bars acording to the unsorted data and will update them accordingly
so my visualizer works like this firstly it has a list of unsorted data and there is a function named show which draws lines with height equal to each element present in the list respectively and then the sorting algorithm sorts the list and then the show function draws the lines with the updated data
the problem is that the algorithm and show function to work properly so i have to sort this problem and solved this by calling the show funcvtion inside the algorithm function



## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install pygame
```

Get the list of choices

```bash
  visualizer list
```
Run the visualizer with the desired option

```bash
  visualizer [1/2/3/4]
```
